    "theme": "default",
    "description": "A schema to showcase grand calculated summaries which include multiple calculated summaries using the same answers. The idea here is that you provide 4 answers on charity donations, that sum up to a total personal donation, and then these answers are re-used in a different calculated summary that sums up how much your job contributes. The final grand calculated summary includes the sum of all your answers, and it may sum up some answers twice, if they are also included in the job match calculated summary. (E.g. if you donate £10 to charity A, and your job matches it, that totals a donation of £20, summing your answer twice)",
